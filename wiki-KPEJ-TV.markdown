## History[ [edit](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=KPEJ-TV&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

KPEJ began in 1986 as an independent station before becoming a [Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Broadcasting_Company "Fox Broadcasting Company") affiliate in 1990. It also had a secondary affiliation with [UPN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPN "UPN") from 1998 to 2003 when [KOSA-TV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KOSA-TV "KOSA-TV") established UPN 16 (now MyTV 16) on its digital subchannel.

After many years, KPEJ rebranded from **Fox 24** to **Fox West Texas**, in August 2007. The following year, it reverted to **Fox 24**, but kept the **Fox West Texas** name for its website and other special promotions.

When it comes to sports in West Texas, KPEJ claims to be the leader with the [NFL on Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFL_on_Fox "NFL on Fox"), College Football on FOX, [Major League Baseball on FOX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_on_FOX "Major League Baseball on FOX"), [NASCAR on Fox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR_on_Fox "NASCAR on Fox"), the [Cotton Bowl Classic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_Bowl_Classic "Cotton Bowl Classic"), UFC on FOX, and the [UEFA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA "UEFA") Champions League Championship, all broadcast by [Fox Sports](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Sports_(USA) "Fox Sports (USA)"). Since the creation of Fox Sports, KPEJ has also served as the home of the [Dallas Cowboys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys "Dallas Cowboys") preseason television network and the Jerry Jones Show. In 2010 KPEJ also picked up the rights to the [Houston Texans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston_Texans "Houston Texans") preseason games, which were shown tape delayed if they began while the Cowboys pregame or preseason game were going on. In 2011 KPEJ lost the Dallas Cowboys preseason games to [KWES](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KWES-TV "KWES-TV"), but they kept the Houston Texans rights and will broadcast all Texans Preseason games live.

Since 2012 KPEJ has a local sports department that produces a web series Sports Talk. The show is hosted by Joel Hawkins and Charles Smith they have a debate and opinion style program that covers local and national sports topics. They do updates from local high school and college sports sites for their Facebook page and website. In 2013 a spin-off version of the show titled Sports Talk MMA debuted that covers The UFC and local MMA. It is hosted by Joel, Charles and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu world champion Brad Barnes.

On April 24, 2013, ComCorp announced the sale of its entire group to the [Nexstar Broadcasting Group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexstar_Broadcasting_Group "Nexstar Broadcasting Group"), the owner of KMID. Since the Odessa–Midland market has only eight full-power stations, Nexstar cannot legally purchase KPEJ ( [Federal Communications Commission](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Communications_Commission "Federal Communications Commission") rules require a market to be left with eight unique station owners after a duopoly is formed). In addition, KMID and KPEJ are two of the top four stations in the market in overall viewership ratings, ranking third and fourth, respectively. As a result, KPEJ will be sold to [Mission Broadcasting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Broadcasting "Mission Broadcasting"). Nexstar will assume operation of the station under a [shared service agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_marketing_agreement "Local marketing agreement"), forming a virtual [duopoly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duopoly_(broadcasting) "Duopoly (broadcasting)") with [KMID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KMID "KMID"). [1] The station's operations will likely be consolidated into KMID's facilities.
