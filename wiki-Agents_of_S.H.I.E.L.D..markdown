## Premise

Main article: [List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episodes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D._episodes "List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episodes")

The series sees [S.H.I.E.L.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D. "S.H.I.E.L.D.") Agent [Phil Coulson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Coulson "Phil Coulson") putting together a small team of S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to handle strange new cases. [4] In the first season, Coulson and his team investigate Project Centipede and their leader, "The Clairvoyant", eventually uncovering that Project Centipede is backed by [Hydra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(comics) "Hydra (comics)"), and they must deal with [Hydra's infiltration of, and the destruction of, S.H.I.E.L.D.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_America:_The_Winter_Soldier "Captain America: The Winter Soldier") In the second season, Coulson and his team look to restore trust from the government and public following S.H.I.E.L.D.'s collapse, while dealing with Hydra members still at large. [5]

## Cast and characters

Main article: [List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Agents_of_S.H.I.E.L.D._characters "List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters")

- [Clark Gregg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gregg "Clark Gregg") as [Phil Coulson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Coulson "Phil Coulson"):

Reprising his role from the MCU films _ [Iron Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_(2008_film) "Iron Man (2008 film)")_, _ [Iron Man 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Man_2 "Iron Man 2")_, _ [Thor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(film) "Thor (film)")_, and _ [Marvel's The Avengers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film) "The Avengers (2012 film)")_, and the Marvel One-Shot short films _ [The Consultant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_One-Shots#The_Consultant_.282011.29 "Marvel One-Shots")_ and _ [A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_One-Shots#A_Funny_Thing_Happened_on_the_Way_to_Thor.27s_Hammer_.282011.29 "Marvel One-Shots")_, [6] Gregg headlines the series, [7] and has appeared in every episode. He was the first principal actor cast in the series. [6] Speaking of his character's resurrection after dying in _The Avengers_, Gregg said, "the mystery and the complexity and the unanswered questions about Phil Coulson standing there trying to deal with this, I found it so fascinating and so true to the world of the comics and mythology in general as I understand them that I was immediately in." [8]
- [Ming-Na Wen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming-Na_Wen "Ming-Na Wen") as Melinda May:

Originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets, [9] Melinda May was created by Joss Whedon, who "has had [the character] rolling around in his head". [10] Wen was cast in the role in October 2012. [11] In preparation for the role, Wen was "given a couple of background stories about her", but found it challenging to play a character who is respected by those around her, even though the audience doesn't know why, stating "It's a challenge in different ways. I think, at this point, I really am starting to know who she is and the stuff that I use to help me understand what could have happened to her to have brought her out of the field and into a desk job, I think we've all pretty much experienced that. So I use some of my own personal experience where we've been scarred or we've been greatly disappointed". [10]
- [Brett Dalton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Dalton "Brett Dalton") as Grant Ward:

"Relative newcomer" Dalton was cast as Ward in November 2012. [12] Talking about creating an original character, Dalton said "In some ways, originating gives you a kind of freedom because there’s not volumes of comic books behind you that you need to live up to." On working with the showrunners he said, "They’re really good at what they do. It feels like how real human beings talk. Also real human beings who have a sense of humor and a sense of humanity and heart. I had a feel for it as soon as I read it. I felt like okay, this is a full character. Because of Marvel’s super secrecy, we only had like three pages to read. We didn’t have a full script, but I felt like there was a full character there on the page. From the very beginning I thought I get this, I get this world and I’d really like to be a part of it." [13]
- [Chloe Bennet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Bennet "Chloe Bennet") as Skye:

In December 2012, Bennet became the final primary cast member for the first season. [14] Concerning Joss Whedon's tendency for writing strong female characters, Bennet said "The best part about Joss casting and writing these sharp female roles is that he doesn't think it's a big deal, because it shouldn't be a big deal. The media attacks out when people write strong male roles, so why isn't something like that talked about when [there are] female roles. To him that's just obvious that it should be done, and that's what I love about it the most." Responding to a comparison between her character, [Buffy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_Summers "Buffy Summers"), [Faith](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_(Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer) "Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)"), and [Willow](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow_Rosenberg "Willow Rosenberg"), Bennet said "I get that a lot! I guess people see the similarities, but I like to think that she is her own character and is going to be even more so coming up through the season, because it does get pretty crazy." [15]
- [Iain De Caestecker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_De_Caestecker "Iain De Caestecker") as Leo Fitz:

De Caestecker was cast in November 2012, [16] and later said that "Fitz has got this funny kind of temper. He’s quite passionate about what he does. So those moments where – I don’t think he’s someone that really responds very quickly to emotion; he doesn’t really understand emotions as much, so when you do see that kind of side to him, I think it’s quite interesting." [17] Fitz has a lot of interaction with Simmons in the series, with De Caestecker explaining "My character, he’s Engineering, so he’s on the computer and tech side of everything. He’s consumed within that world, and he works very closely with Simmons, who’s Biochem. They’ve got this kind of weird chemistry together, and they just kind of fit each other in a very weird way." [18]
- [Elizabeth Henstridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Henstridge "Elizabeth Henstridge") as Jemma Simmons:

Henstridge was also cast in November 2012, [16] describing her character as "a biochem expert. She’s young and hungry and she’s a great woman to play because she’s intelligent and focused and curious and she doesn’t apologize for it. She’s got a wonderful relationship with Fitz. They kind of bounce off each other." [19] She also talked about the characters being separated, saying "That's interesting because then you see that they've never been without each other. When you see them without each other, that brings a whole new dynamic just to them as characters in discovering what it's like to have to be independent because this whole S.H.I.E.L.D. team has come together and everybody is on their own apart from Fitz-Simmons. We will get to see that and it's quite funny." [20]
- [Nick Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Blood "Nick Blood") as [Lance Hunter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Hunter "Lance Hunter"):

Blood was announced as cast in the second season at the 2014 [San Diego Comic Con](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic_Con "San Diego Comic Con"), [21] and in September 2014, he was confirmed to be a member of the principal cast for the season. [22] The character has been described as not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, but a mercenary. [21]
## Production

After [The Walt Disney Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company "The Walt Disney Company") purchased [Marvel Entertainment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Entertainment "Marvel Entertainment") in 2009, [23] they announced that a [Marvel Television](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Television "Marvel Television") division was being formed. [24] [25] In the following months, various pilots based on comics from Marvel's catalog went into development. [26] [27]

In July 2012, Marvel Television entered into discussions with [ABC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company "American Broadcasting Company") to do a new show set in the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe "Marvel Cinematic Universe"), though at that point it was undecided what the show would be. It was described as "'a kernel of an idea' with a number of scenarios being explored, including a high-concept cop show." [28] In August 2012, it was announced that _ [Marvel's The Avengers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film) "The Avengers (2012 film)")_ director [Joss Whedon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon "Joss Whedon"), creator of other popular television shows such as _ [Buffy the Vampire Slayer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_(TV_series) "Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)")_ and _ [Firefly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly_(TV_series) "Firefly (TV series)")_, would be involved in the show's development. [29] A few weeks later, ABC ordered a pilot for a show called _S.H.I.E.L.D._ to be written and directed by Joss Whedon, with [Jed Whedon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jed_Whedon "Jed Whedon") and [Maurissa Tancharoen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurissa_Tancharoen "Maurissa Tancharoen") also writing. Jed Whedon, Tancharoen and Jeffrey Bell would act as the series' [showrunners](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showrunner "Showrunner"). [30] [31] Disney CEO [Bob Iger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger "Bob Iger") greenlit the S.H.I.E.L.D. series after watching the [Marvel One-Shot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_One-Shot "Marvel One-Shot") short film _Item 47_, about S.H.I.E.L.D. agents pursuing a couple in possession of a [Chitauri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitauri "Chitauri") weapon used in the Battle of New York in _The Avengers_. [32]

In April 2013, ABC announced that the show would be titled _Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ [4] and eventually officially picked up the series for a full season. [33] [34] In May 2014, _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ was renewed for a second season. [35] Composer [Bear McCreary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_McCreary "Bear McCreary") confirmed that he would compose music for the series in July 2013. [36] Filming for the series takes place in [Culver City, California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culver_City,_California "Culver City, California"), while the main [visual effects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects "Visual effects") for the series are done by FuseFX, [37] with additional help from CoSA VFX. [38] Additionally, [Industrial Light & Magic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Light_%26_Magic "Industrial Light & Magic") shares assets from the [films](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Cinematic_Universe_films "List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films") to ensure consistency across the properties. [37]

### Writing

In July 2013, Maurissa Tancharoen revealed on her [Twitter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter "Twitter") page that Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, Jeff Bell, [Paul Zbyszewski](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Zbyszewski "Paul Zbyszewski"), [Monica Owusu-Breen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monica_Breen "Monica Breen"), [Brent Fletcher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brent_Fletcher "Brent Fletcher"), Lauren LeFranc, [Rafe Judkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafe_Judkins "Rafe Judkins"), and Shalisha Francis would be the writers for the series. [39] Bell, Jed Whedon, and Tancharoen supervise all creative decisions, with Joss Whedon assisting as well before starting work on _Avengers: Age of Ultron_. [40] Bell explained the writing process, saying "While one person is writing a script, I can have two of us break other stories so I can have, in theory, a story broken every couple of weeks. That’s the only way we can get ahead of the production train, because we shoot a new episode every eight days. If there’s a story that I, Jed and Maurissa like we say ‘Yes,’ that writer goes off and writes their outline, we give them notes, they write a script and then we send this to network and get their notes, then get production feedback on what we can and cannot do, that writer then goes off and is on set producing the episode". [40]

### Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins

In July 2013, Jed Whedon said the series will work in tandem with the Marvel films, both past and upcoming, saying, “We plan on trying to weave in between the films and try to make them more rewarding on both ends.” [41] In March 2014, the producers stated at the show's PaleyFest panel that they and the writers are able to read the screenplays for upcoming MCU films to know where the universe is heading, which allowed them to form a general plan for the show through the end of a third season, should the show be renewed for such. [42] Elaborating, Jed Whedon said, "The idea with every Marvel property is for them to exist on their own and then interweave. No one backswipes; Thor didn’t show up in _Iron Man 3_. It’s not that these things are dependent on one another. They had the opportunity to interact and they exist in the same universe and we are in the same universe and when we establish something in our universe, in our show, it becomes a rule in the universe so we have to make sure we’re respectful of what they’re planning to do and that we’re all on the same page." [43]

In September 2014, Bell explained the process of working on a show set in the MCU that was established by the film: "Marvel is complicated in that we’re part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and so after [running something by Jeph] Loeb we’ll run it through New York, [Joe Quesada](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Quesada "Joe Quesada"), Dan Buckley and those guys. We pitch our stuff to [Kevin Feige](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Feige "Kevin Feige") and his movie group to see if there’s something we can tie into, to see if they’re okay about us using a character, or a weapon or some other cool thing. Everything is interconnected, and that’s really what we have to pay the most attention to. It’s challenging but fun as we try to lace some Easter egg in, something that ties into a movie or, if not, at least the comics so fans can find those little things that nobody else knows about." [40]

The series' first tie-in episode with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is in the episode "The Well", which takes place after the events of the 2013 film _ [Thor: The Dark World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor:_The_Dark_World "Thor: The Dark World")_. [44] A second tie-in takes place revolving around the events of _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_, [45] in the episodes "End of the Beginning" and "Turn, Turn, Turn", [46] which eventually lead to a retooling of the show for the final episodes of season 1. [47] Beginning with "T.A.H.I.T.I.", all episodes leading up to _The Winter Soldier_ crossover were part of a series of episodes dubbed "Uprising". [48] For the second season, Tancharoen stated the production team was not ruling out creating crossover episodes with _ [Agent Carter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Carter_(TV_series) "Agent Carter (TV series)")_ or _ [Guardians of the Galaxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(film) "Guardians of the Galaxy (film)")_, with Whedon adding that any such episodes would not equal the scale seen in the _The Winter Soldier_ crossover, saying, "In terms of game-changers, [those episodes are] hard to beat." [49]

### Casting

In October 2012, Clark Gregg was the first principal cast member announced for the series, reprising his role as Phil Coulson. [6] Over the next two months, [Ming-Na Wen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming-Na_Wen "Ming-Na Wen") was cast as Melinda May, [11] [Elizabeth Henstridge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Henstridge "Elizabeth Henstridge") and [Iain De Caestecker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iain_De_Caestecker "Iain De Caestecker") were cast as Jemma Simmons and Leo Fitz, respectively, [16] [Brett Dalton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Dalton "Brett Dalton") was cast as Grant Ward [12] and [Chloe Bennet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloe_Bennet "Chloe Bennet") was cast as Skye, rounding out the principal cast for the first season. [14] All returned as principal cast members for the second season, and were joined by [Nick Blood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Blood "Nick Blood") as [Lance Hunter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance_Hunter "Lance Hunter"). [21] [22]

[56] In New Zealand, the first episode premiered on February 16, 2014 to 326,790 viewers, the fourth highest show of the night, and the most watched show on [TV2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV2_(New_Zealand) "TV2 (New Zealand)"). [68]

### Reviews

Before the premiere, the entire pilot was screened at San Diego Comic-Con International in July 2013, and was met with a very positive reaction from the crowd. [69] Critically, the initial screening of the pilot was met with mostly positive reviews. As of September 28, 2013, based on the pilot, the first season has received positive reviews from some critics, and received a [Metacritic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic "Metacritic") score of 74 out of 100, based on 32 reviews. [70] [IGN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN "IGN") gave the pilot an 8.5 out of 10, saying it "quickly hits the right notes to firmly show how it exists on the ground level" of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. [71]_ [The New York Times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")_' Brooks Barnes felt the storyline in the pilot was hard to follow at times, and did not like the thick accents of De Caestecker and Henstridge. He also added that "what goes over well at Comic-Con does not necessarily work in the real world," especially on a network with "_ [Scandal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandal_(TV_series) "Scandal (TV series)")_ moms and _ [Dancing with the Stars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_with_the_Stars_(U.S._TV_series) "Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)")_ grandparents". [72]

_ [Entertainment Weekly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entertainment_Weekly "Entertainment Weekly")_'s initial reactions were that if everything that made the show appealing—its continuity with Marvel Cinematic Universe, its continuance of the _The Avengers_ storyline, and Whedon's return to television—were stripped from it, the show would still work. However, they also questioned whether the show was accessible enough to attract a wider audience. [73]_ [Variety](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine) "Variety (magazine)")_'s Brian Lowry felt that the "pilot picks up where '_Avengers_' left off, but doesn't pack quite the same punch," adding that the banter "occasionally feels a little precious and clunky." [1]

[Jim Steranko](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Steranko "Jim Steranko"), an artist and writer who worked on 18 of the _Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D._ comic books between 1966 and 1968, was critical of the pilot episode, lamenting that "the show had no menace, no tension." [74] For the second episode, Steranko said that it was "too unfocused to be satisfying," but praised Jackson's cameo as Nick Fury as "an electrifying reminder of what the series could and should be." [75] In contrast, Steranko's opinion of some later episodes in the first season were more positive, congratulating the writer and director of "The End of the Beginning" for "finding an entertaining, bravura groove that finally brings the concept to life", [76] and saying of the next episode "I was concerned that last week’s bravura transformation was only a fluke, but it was apparent from the opening moments that the exec lineup’s new image-and-edit policy was in play." [77] Overall, however, he found season 1 to be "22 episodes of 'sanctified' plot and character crumbs being salted with terminally-sluggish velocity (into anemic 'standalone' stories)". [78]

### Awards

In June 2013, the series was awarded, along with five other shows, the [Critics' Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critics%27_Choice_Television_Award_for_Most_Exciting_New_Series "Critics' Choice Television Award for Most Exciting New Series"). [79] In September 2013, it was named "The Most Promising New Fall Series" by the [Television Critics Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television_Critics_Association "Television Critics Association"). [80] The show received two nominations at the [40th People's Choice Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_People%27s_Choice_Awards "40th People's Choice Awards"), for Favorite New TV Drama, and [Ming-Na Wen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming-Na_Wen "Ming-Na Wen") was nominated for Favorite Actress in a New TV Series. [81] The series was nominated for Best Network Television Series at the [40th Saturn Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/40th_Saturn_Awards "40th Saturn Awards"). [82] For the [66th Primetime Emmy Awards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/66th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards "66th Primetime Emmy Awards"), the series received a nomination for Outstanding Special and Visual Effects. [83]

In July 2014, Marvel Custom Solutions and [Lexus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexus "Lexus") announced a custom comic, _Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: The Chase_ #1. The comic shows a never before seen mission, taking place after the season 1 episode, "Seeds". Jonathan Rheingold, Vice President of Marvel Custom Solutions said, "Lexus, Marvel and the team behind _Marvel’s Agents S.H.I.E.L.D._ collaborated to create a backstory to the TV series that has utter continuity with the show, and offer existing fans exclusive content". [84]

Also in July 2014 at [San Diego Comic-Con International](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Comic-Con_International "San Diego Comic-Con International"), [Marvel Comics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Comics "Marvel Comics") announced the ongoing series titled _S.H.I.E.L.D._, which will be set in the mainstream [Marvel Universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Universe "Marvel Universe") (also known as [Earth-616](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth-616 "Earth-616")). The series will be written by [Mark Waid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Waid "Mark Waid") and art by a rotating group of artists including [Carlos Pacheco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Pacheco "Carlos Pacheco"), [Alan Davis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Davis "Alan Davis"), and [Chris Sprouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sprouse "Chris Sprouse") beginning December 2014. The series is led by Agent Coulson, and will see the canonical introduction of characters that originated from the television series, to which Waid said, "This is our chance to introduce a lot of the other characters into the Marvel Universe, and give them the Marvel Universe spin." Waid described the series as "done-in-one. Coulson and his team have a mission, and if we need someone for a mission, everyone in the Marvel Universe is available as a potential Agent." [85] [86]
