# Technological singularity

The **technological singularity** is the theoretical emergence of greater-than-human [superintelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence "Superintelligence") through technological means. [1] Since the capabilities of such intelligence would be difficult for an unaided human mind to comprehend, the occurrence of a technological singularity is seen as an intellectual [event horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon "Event horizon"), beyond which events cannot be predicted.

Proponents of the singularity typically state that an "intelligence explosion", [2] [3] where superintelligences design successive generations of increasingly powerful minds, might occur very quickly and might not stop until the agent's cognitive abilities greatly surpass that of any human.

The term was popularized by science fiction writer [Vernor Vinge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernor_Vinge "Vernor Vinge"), who argues that [artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence"), [human biological enhancement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_enhancement "Human enhancement"), or [brain-computer interfaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface "Brain–computer interface") could be possible causes of the singularity. The specific term "singularity" as a description for a phenomenon of technological acceleration causing an eventual unpredictable outcome in society was coined by mathematician [John von Neumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann"), who in the mid 1950s spoke of "ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue." The concept has also been popularized by futurists such as [Ray Kurzweil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil "Ray Kurzweil"), who cited von Neumann's use of the term in a foreword to von Neumann's classic "The Computer and the Brain."

Some analysts expect the singularity to occur some time in the 21st century, although their estimates vary.

  [Kurzweil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Kurzweil "Ray Kurzweil") writes that, due to [paradigm shifts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift "Paradigm shift"), a trend of exponential growth extends [Moore's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law "Moore's law") to [integrated circuits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuits "Integrated circuits") from earlier [transistors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor "Transistor"), [vacuum tubes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube "Vacuum tube"), [relays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay "Relay"), and [electromechanical](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromechanics "Electromechanics") computers. He predicts that the exponential growth will continue, and that in a few decades the computing power of all computers will exceed that of human brains, with superhuman [artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") appearing around the same time.

Many of the most recognized writers on the singularity, such as Vernor Vinge and Ray Kurzweil, define the concept in terms of the technological creation of superintelligence, and argue that it is difficult or impossible for present-day humans to predict what a post-singularity would be like, due to the difficulty of imagining the intentions and capabilities of superintelligent entities. [4] [5] [6] The term "technological singularity" was originally coined by Vinge, who made an analogy between the breakdown in our ability to predict what would happen after the development of superintelligence and the breakdown of the predictive ability of modern [physics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics "Physics") at the [space-time singularity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity "Gravitational singularity") beyond the [event horizon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon "Event horizon") of a [black hole](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole "Black hole"). [6]

Some writers use "the singularity" in a broader way to refer to any radical changes in our society brought about by new technologies such as [molecular nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology "Molecular nanotechnology"), [7] [8] [9] although Vinge and other prominent writers specifically state that without superintelligence, such changes would not qualify as a true singularity. [4] Many writers also tie the singularity to observations of exponential growth in various technologies (with [Moore's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_Law "Moore's Law") being the most prominent example), using such observations as a basis for predicting that the singularity is likely to happen sometime within the 21st century. [8] [10]

A technological singularity includes the concept of an intelligence explosion, a term coined in 1965 by [I. J. Good](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good "I. J. Good"). [11] Although technological progress has been accelerating, it has been limited by the basic intelligence of the human brain, which has not, according to [Paul R. Ehrlich](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_R._Ehrlich "Paul R. Ehrlich"), changed significantly for millennia. [12] However, with the increasing power of computers and other technologies, it might eventually be possible to build a machine that is more intelligent than humanity. [13] If superhuman intelligences were invented, either through the [amplification of human intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_amplification "Intelligence amplification") or artificial intelligence, it would bring to bear greater problem-solving and inventive skills than humans, then it could design a yet more capable machine, or re-write its source code to become more intelligent. This more capable machine could then go on to design a machine of even greater capability. These iterations could accelerate, leading to [recursive self-improvement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_AI "Seed AI"), potentially allowing enormous qualitative change before any upper limits imposed by the laws of physics or theoretical computation set in. [14] [15] [16]

The exponential growth in computing technology suggested by Moore's Law is commonly cited as a reason to expect a singularity in the relatively near future, and a number of authors have proposed generalizations of Moore's Law. Computer scientist and futurist [Hans Moravec](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Moravec "Hans Moravec") proposed in a 1998 book that the exponential growth curve could be extended back through earlier computing technologies prior to the [integrated circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit"). Futurist Ray Kurzweil postulates a [law of accelerating returns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_accelerating_returns "Law of accelerating returns") in which the speed of technological change (and more generally, all evolutionary processes [17]) increases exponentially, generalizing Moore's Law in the same manner as Moravec's proposal, and also including material technology (especially as applied to [nanotechnology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanotechnology "Nanotechnology")), medical technology and others. [18] Like other authors, though, he reserves the term "singularity" for a rapid increase in intelligence (as opposed to other technologies), writing for example that "The Singularity will allow us to transcend these limitations of our biological bodies and brains ... There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine". [19] He also defines his predicted date of the singularity (2045) in terms of when he expects computer-based intelligences to significantly exceed the sum total of human brainpower, writing that advances in computing before that date "will not represent the Singularity" because they do "not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence." [20]

The term "technological singularity" reflects the idea that such change may happen suddenly, and that it is difficult to predict how such a new world would operate. [21] [22] It is unclear whether an intelligence explosion of this kind would be beneficial or harmful, or even an [existential threat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk "Existential risk"), [23] [24] as the issue has not been dealt with by most [artificial general intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence "Artificial general intelligence") researchers, although the topic of [friendly artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_AI "Friendly AI") is investigated by the [Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_Institute_for_Artificial_Intelligence "Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence") and the [Future of Humanity Institute](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Humanity_Institute "Future of Humanity Institute"). [21]

Many prominent technologists and academics dispute the plausibility of a technological singularity, including [Jeff Hawkins](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Hawkins "Jeff Hawkins"), [John Holland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Henry_Holland "John Henry Holland"), [Jaron Lanier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaron_Lanier "Jaron Lanier"), and [Gordon Moore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Moore "Gordon Moore"), whose [Moore's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_Law "Moore's Law") is often cited in support of the concept. [25] [26]

## History of the idea

In the middle of the 19th century [Friedrich Engels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Engels "Friedrich Engels") wrote that science moves forward proportionally to the "mass of knowledge" inherited from the previous generations, he proposed a more formal mathematical concept that, since the 16th century, the development of the sciences had been increasing proportionally to the squared distance in time from its start.[_ [citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

In 1847, R. Thornton, the editor of _The Expounder of Primitive Christianity_, [27] wrote about the recent invention of a four function [mechanical calculator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_calculator "Mechanical calculator"):

>  
...such machines, by which the scholar may, by turning a crank, grind out the solution of a problem without the fatigue of mental application, would by its introduction into schools, do incalculable injury. But who knows that such machines when brought to greater perfection, may not think of a plan to remedy all their own defects and then grind out ideas beyond the ken of mortal mind!

In 1951, [Alan Turing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing "Alan Turing") spoke of machines outstripping humans intellectually: [28]

>  
once the machine thinking method has started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers. ... At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in [Samuel Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Butler_(novelist) "Samuel Butler (novelist)")'s _ [Erewhon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon "Erewhon")_.

In the mid fifties [Stanislaw Ulam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislaw_Ulam "Stanislaw Ulam") had a conversation with [John von Neumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann") in which von Neumann spoke of "ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue."

In 1965, I. J. Good first wrote of an "intelligence explosion", suggesting that if machines could even slightly surpass human intellect, they could improve their own designs in ways unforeseen by their designers, and thus [recursively](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion "Recursion") augment themselves into far greater intelligences. The first such improvements might be small, but as the machine became more intelligent it would become better at becoming more intelligent, which could lead to a cascade of self-improvements and a sudden surge to superintelligence (or a singularity).

In 1983, mathematician and author Vernor Vinge greatly popularized Good’s notion of an intelligence explosion in a number of writings, first addressing the topic in print in the January 1983 issue of _ [Omni](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omni_(magazine) "Omni (magazine)")_ magazine. In this op-ed piece, Vinge seems to have been the first to use the term "singularity" in a way that was specifically tied to the creation of intelligent machines, [29] [30] writing:

>  
We will soon create intelligences greater than our own. When this happens, human history will have reached a kind of singularity, an intellectual transition as impenetrable as the knotted space-time at the center of a black hole, and the world will pass far beyond our understanding. This singularity, I believe, already haunts a number of science-fiction writers. It makes realistic extrapolation to an interstellar future impossible. To write a story set more than a century hence, one needs a nuclear war in between ... so that the world remains intelligible.

In 1984, [Samuel R. Delany](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_R._Delany "Samuel R. Delany") used "cultural fugue" as a plot device in his science fiction novel _ [Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_in_My_Pocket_Like_Grains_of_Sand "Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand")_; the terminal runaway of technological and cultural complexity in effect destroys all life on any world on which it transpires, a process which is poorly understood by the novel's characters, and against which they seek a stable defense. In 1985 [Ray Solomonoff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Solomonoff "Ray Solomonoff") introduced the notion of "infinity point" [31] in the time scale of artificial intelligence, analyzed the magnitude of the " [future shock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_shock "Future shock")" that "we can expect from our AI expanded scientific community" and on social effects. Estimates were made "for when these milestones would occur, followed by some suggestions for the more effective utilization of the extremely rapid technological growth that is expected."

Vinge also popularized the concept in SF novels such as _ [Marooned in Realtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marooned_in_Realtime "Marooned in Realtime")_ (1986) and _ [A Fire Upon the Deep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep "A Fire Upon the Deep")_ (1992). The former is set in a world of rapidly [accelerating change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change "Accelerating change") leading to the emergence of more and more sophisticated technologies separated by shorter and shorter time intervals, until a point beyond human comprehension is reached. The latter starts with an imaginative description of the evolution of a superintelligence passing through exponentially accelerating developmental stages ending in a [transcendent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_(philosophy) "Transcendence (philosophy)"), almost [omnipotent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotent "Omnipotent") power unfathomable by mere humans. It is also implied that the development does not stop at this level.

In his 1988 book _Mind Children_, computer scientist and futurist Hans Moravec generalizes Moore's law to make predictions about the future of artificial life. Moravec outlines a timeline and a scenario in this regard, [32] [33] in that the robots will evolve into a new series of artificial species, starting around 2030–2040. [34] In _Robot: Mere Machine to Transcendent Mind_, published in 1998, Moravec further considers the implications of evolving [robot intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_intelligence "Robot intelligence"), generalizing Moore's law to technologies predating the [integrated circuit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit "Integrated circuit"), and speculating about a coming "mind fire" of rapidly expanding superintelligence, similar to Vinge's ideas.

A 1993 article by Vinge, "The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era", [4] was widely disseminated on the internet and helped to popularize the idea. [35] This article contains the oft-quoted statement, "Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended." Vinge refines his estimate of the time scales involved, adding, "I'll be surprised if this event occurs before 2005 or after 2030."

Vinge predicted four ways the singularity could occur: [36]

1. The development of computers that are "awake" and superhumanly intelligent.
2. Large computer networks (and their associated users) may "wake up" as a superhumanly intelligent entity.
3. Computer/human interfaces may become so intimate that users may reasonably be considered superhumanly intelligent.
4. Biological science may find ways to improve upon the natural human intellect.

Vinge continues by predicting that superhuman intelligences will be able to enhance their own minds faster than their human creators. "When greater-than-human intelligence drives progress," Vinge writes, "that progress will be much more rapid." This [feedback loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_loop "Feedback loop") of self-improving intelligence, he predicts, will cause large amounts of technological progress within a short period, and that the creation of superhuman intelligence represented a breakdown in humans' ability to model their future. His argument was that authors cannot write realistic characters who surpass the human intellect, as the thoughts of such an intellect would be beyond the ability of humans to express. Vinge named this event "the Singularity".

[Damien Broderick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Broderick "Damien Broderick")'s [popular science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science "Popular science") book [The Spike (1997)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Spike_(1997) "The Spike (1997)") was the first to investigate the technological singularity in detail.

In 2000, [Bill Joy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Joy "Bill Joy"), a prominent technologist and founder of [Sun Microsystems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems "Sun Microsystems"), voiced concern over the potential dangers of the singularity. [37]

In 2005, Ray Kurzweil published _ [The Singularity is Near](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_is_Near "The Singularity is Near")_, which brought the idea of the singularity to the popular media both through the book's accessibility and a publicity campaign that included an appearance on _ [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Show_with_Jon_Stewart "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart")_. [38] The book stirred intense controversy, in part because Kurzweil's [utopian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopian "Utopian") predictions contrasted starkly with other, darker visions of the possibilities of the singularity. Kurzweil, his theories, and the controversies surrounding it were the subject of [Barry Ptolemy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Ptolemy "Barry Ptolemy")'s documentary _ [Transcendent Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendent_Man_(film) "Transcendent Man (film)")_.

In 2007, [Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky "Eliezer Yudkowsky") suggested that many of the different definitions that have been assigned to "singularity" are mutually incompatible rather than mutually supporting. [8] For example, Kurzweil extrapolates current technological trajectories past the arrival of self-improving AI or superhuman intelligence, which Yudkowsky argues represents a tension with both I. J. Good's proposed discontinuous upswing in intelligence and Vinge's thesis on unpredictability.

In 2008, [Robin Hanson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson "Robin Hanson") (taking "singularity" to refer to sharp increases in the exponent of economic growth) lists the [Agricultural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution "Neolithic Revolution") and [Industrial Revolutions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution "Industrial Revolution") as past singularities. Extrapolating from such past events, Hanson proposes that the next economic singularity should increase [economic growth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_growth "Economic growth") between 60 and 250 times. An innovation that allowed for the replacement of virtually all human labor could trigger this event. [39]

In 2009, Kurzweil and [X-Prize](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Prize "X-Prize") founder [Peter Diamandis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Diamandis "Peter Diamandis") announced the establishment of [Singularity University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity_University "Singularity University"), whose stated mission is "to assemble, educate and inspire a cadre of leaders who strive to understand and facilitate the development of exponentially advancing technologies in order to address humanity’s grand challenges." [40] Funded by [Google](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google "Google"), [Autodesk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk "Autodesk"), [ePlanet Ventures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPlanet_Ventures "EPlanet Ventures"), and a group of technology industry leaders, Singularity University is based at [NASA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA "NASA")'s [Ames Research Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Ames_Research_Center "NASA Ames Research Center") in [Mountain View](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_View,_California "Mountain View, California"), [California](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California"). The not-for-profit organization runs an annual ten-week graduate program during the summer that covers ten different technology and allied tracks, and a series of executive programs throughout the year.

In 2010, [Aubrey de Grey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey "Aubrey de Grey") applied the term the " [Methuselarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methuselah#Use_of_the_word_in_modern_life "Methuselah")" [41] to the point at which medical technology improves so fast that [expected human lifespan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy "Life expectancy") increases by more than one year per year. In 2010 in "Apocalyptic AI – Visions of Heaven in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality" [42] Robert Geraci offers an account of the developing "cyber-theology" inspired by Singularity studies. A book exploring some of those themes is the 1996 [Holy Fire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Fire "Holy Fire") by Bruce Sterling, which postulates that a Methuselarity will become a [gerontocracy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerontocracy "Gerontocracy").

In 2011, Kurzweil noted existing trends and concluded that the singularity was becoming more probable to occur around 2045. He told _Time_ magazine: "We will successfully reverse-engineer the human brain by the mid-2020s. By the end of that decade, computers will be capable of human-level intelligence." [43]

## Intelligence explosion

The notion of an "intelligence explosion" was first described thus by Good (1965), who speculated on the effects of superhuman machines:

>  
Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an ‘intelligence explosion,’ and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make.

Most proposed methods for creating superhuman or [transhuman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhuman "Transhuman") minds fall into one of two categories, intelligence amplification of human brains and artificial intelligence. The means speculated to produce intelligence augmentation are numerous, and include [bioengineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioengineering "Bioengineering"), [genetic engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_engineering "Genetic engineering"), [nootropic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic "Nootropic") drugs, AI assistants, direct brain-computer interfaces and [mind uploading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading "Mind uploading"). The existence of multiple paths to an intelligence explosion makes a singularity more likely; for a singularity to not occur they would all have to fail. [6]

Hanson (1998) is skeptical of human intelligence augmentation, writing that once one has exhausted the "low-hanging fruit" of easy methods for increasing human intelligence, further improvements will become increasingly difficult to find. Despite the numerous speculated means for amplifying human intelligence, non-human artificial intelligence (specifically [seed AI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_AI "Seed AI")) is the most popular option for organizations trying to advance the singularity.[_ [citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

Whether or not an intelligence explosion occurs depends on three factors. [44] The first, accelerating factor, is the new intelligence enhancements made possible by each previous improvement. Contrariwise, as the intelligences become more advanced, further advances will become more and more complicated, possibly overcoming the advantage of increased intelligence. Each improvement must be able to beget at least one more improvement, on average, for the singularity to continue. Finally, there is the issue of a hard upper limit. Absent [quantum computing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computer "Quantum computer"), eventually the laws of physics will prevent any further improvements.

There are two logically independent, but mutually reinforcing, accelerating effects: increases in the speed of computation, and improvements to the [algorithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") used. [45] The former is predicted by Moore’s Law and the forecast improvements in hardware, [46] and is comparatively similar to previous technological advance. On the other hand, most AI researchers believe that software is more important than hardware.[_ [citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

### Speed improvements

The first is the improvements to the speed at which minds can be run. Whether human or AI, better hardware increases the rate of future hardware improvements. Oversimplified, [47] Moore's Law suggests that if the first doubling of speed took 18 months, the second would take 18 subjective months; or 9 external months, whereafter, four months, two months, and so on towards a speed singularity. [48] An upper limit on speed may eventually be reached, although it is unclear how high this would be. Hawkins (2008), responding to Good, argued that the upper limit is relatively low;

>  
Belief in this idea is based on a naive understanding of what intelligence is. As an analogy, imagine we had a computer that could design new computers (chips, systems, and software) faster than itself. Would such a computer lead to infinitely fast computers or even computers that were faster than anything humans could ever build? No. It might accelerate the rate of improvements for a while, but in the end there are limits to how big and fast computers can run. We would end up in the same place; we'd just get there a bit faster. There would be no singularity.  
Whereas if it were a lot higher than current human levels of intelligence, the effects of the singularity would be enormous enough as to be indistinguishable (to humans) from a singularity with an upper limit. For example, if the speed of thought could be increased a million-fold, a subjective year would pass in 30 physical seconds. [6]

It is difficult to directly compare [silicon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon "Silicon")-based hardware with [neurons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron "Neuron"). But Berglas (2008) notes that computer [speech recognition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition "Speech recognition") is approaching human capabilities, and that this capability seems to require 0.01% of the volume of the brain. This analogy suggests that modern computer hardware is within a few orders of magnitude of being as powerful as the human brain.

### Intelligence improvements

Some intelligence technologies, like seed AI, may also have the potential to make themselves more intelligent, not just faster, by modifying their [source code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code "Source code"). These improvements would make further improvements possible, which would make further improvements possible, and so on.

This mechanism for an intelligence explosion differs from an increase in speed in two ways. First, it does not require external effect: machines designing faster hardware still require humans to create the improved hardware, or to program factories appropriately. An AI which was rewriting its own source code, however, could do so while contained in an [AI box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_box "AI box").

Second, as with Vernor Vinge’s conception of the singularity, it is much harder to predict the outcome. While speed increases seem to be only a quantitative difference from human intelligence, actual improvements in intelligence would be qualitatively different. Eliezer Yudkowsky compares it to the changes that human intelligence brought: humans changed the world thousands of times more rapidly than evolution had done, and in totally different ways. Similarly, the evolution of life had been a massive departure and acceleration from the previous geological rates of change, and improved intelligence could cause change to be as different again. [49]

There are substantial dangers associated with an intelligence explosion singularity. First, the goal structure of the AI may not be invariant under self-improvement, potentially causing the AI to optimise for something other than was intended. [50] [51] Secondly, AIs could compete for the scarce resources mankind uses to survive. [52]

While not actively malicious, there is no reason to think that AIs would actively promote human goals unless they could be programmed as such, and if not, might use the resources currently used to support mankind to promote its own goals, causing human extinction. [10] [53] [54]

### Impact

Dramatic changes in the rate of economic growth have occurred in the past because of some technological advancement. Based on population growth, the economy doubled every 250,000 years from the [Paleolithic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic "Paleolithic") era until the [Neolithic Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic_Revolution "Neolithic Revolution"). This new agricultural economy began to double every 900 years, a remarkable increase. In the current era, beginning with the Industrial Revolution, the world’s economic output doubles every fifteen years, sixty times faster than during the agricultural era. If the rise of superhuman intelligences causes a similar revolution, argues Robin Hanson, one would expect the economy to double at least quarterly and possibly on a weekly basis. [39]

#### Existential risk

Berglas (2008) notes that there is no direct evolutionary motivation for an AI to be friendly to humans. Evolution has no inherent tendency to produce outcomes valued by humans, and there is little reason to expect an arbitrary optimisation process to promote an outcome desired by mankind, rather than inadvertently leading to an AI behaving in a way not intended by its creators (such as Nick Bostrom's whimsical example of an AI which was originally programmed with the goal of manufacturing paper clips, so that when it achieves superintelligence it decides to convert the entire planet into a paper clip manufacturing facility; [55] [56] [57] [Anders Sandberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Sandberg "Anders Sandberg") has also elaborated on this scenario, addressing various common counter-arguments. [58]) AI researcher [Hugo de Garis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_de_Garis "Hugo de Garis") suggests that artificial intelligences may simply eliminate the human race for access to scarce resources, [52] [59] and humans would be powerless to stop them. [60] Alternatively, AIs developed under evolutionary pressure to promote their own survival could outcompete humanity. [54]

Bostrom (2002) discusses human extinction scenarios, and lists superintelligence as a possible cause:

>  
When we create the first superintelligent entity, we might make a mistake and give it goals that lead it to annihilate humankind, assuming its enormous intellectual advantage gives it the power to do so. For example, we could mistakenly elevate a subgoal to the status of a supergoal. We tell it to solve a mathematical problem, and it complies by turning all the matter in the solar system into a giant calculating device, in the process killing the person who asked the question.

A significant problem is that unfriendly artificial intelligence is likely to be much easier to create than friendly AI. While both require large advances in recursive optimisation process design, friendly AI also requires the ability to make goal structures invariant under self-improvement (or the AI could transform itself into something unfriendly) and a goal structure that aligns with human values and does not automatically destroy the human race. An unfriendly AI, on the other hand, can optimize for an arbitrary goal structure, which does not need to be invariant under self-modification. [61]

[Eliezer Yudkowsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Yudkowsky "Eliezer Yudkowsky") proposed that research be undertaken to produce [friendly artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendly_artificial_intelligence "Friendly artificial intelligence") in order to address the dangers. He noted that the first real AI would have a head start on self-improvement and, if friendly, could prevent unfriendly AIs from developing, as well as providing enormous benefits to mankind. [53] [Bill Hibbard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hibbard "Bill Hibbard") also addresses issues of AI safety and morality in his book _ [Super-Intelligent Machines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super-Intelligent_Machines "Super-Intelligent Machines")_.

One hypothetical approach towards attempting to control an artificial intelligence is an [AI box](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_box "AI box"), where the artificial intelligence is kept constrained inside a [simulated world](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation "Computer simulation") and not allowed to affect the external world. However, a sufficiently intelligent AI may simply be able to escape by outsmarting its less intelligent human captors. [21] [62] [63]

### Implications for human society

In 2009, leading computer scientists, artificial intelligence researchers, and roboticists met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds near [Monterey Bay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Bay "Monterey Bay") in California. The goal was to discuss the potential impact of the hypothetical possibility that robots could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire [autonomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy "Autonomy"), and to what degree they could use such abilities to pose threats or hazards.

Some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including the ability to locate their own power sources and choose targets to attack with weapons. Also, some [computer viruses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_viruses "Computer viruses") can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence."[_ [citation needed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] The conference attendees noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that other potential hazards and pitfalls exist. [64]

Some experts and academics have questioned the use of [robots](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot "Robot") for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions. [65] A [United States Navy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy "United States Navy") report indicates that, as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions. [66] [67]

The [Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_the_Advancement_of_Artificial_Intelligence "Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence") has commissioned a study to examine this issue, [68] pointing to programs like the [Language Acquisition Device](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Acquisition_Device_(computer) "Language Acquisition Device (computer)"), which can emulate human interaction.

Some support the design of friendly artificial intelligence, meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane. [69]

[Isaac Asimov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov")'s [Three Laws of Robotics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics "Three Laws of Robotics") is one of the earliest examples of proposed safety measures for AI. The laws are intended to prevent artificially intelligent robots from harming humans. In Asimov’s stories, any perceived problems with the laws tend to arise as a result of a misunderstanding on the part of some human operator; the robots themselves are merely acting to their best interpretation of their rules. In the [2004](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_in_film "2004 in film") film _ [I, Robot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film) "I, Robot (film)")_, loosely based on Asimov's [_Robot_ stories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_series_(Asimov) "Robot series (Asimov)"), an AI attempts to take complete control over humanity for the purpose of protecting humanity from itself due to [an extrapolation of the Three Laws](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_Law "Zeroth Law"). In 2004, the Singularity Institute launched an Internet campaign called _3 Laws Unsafe_ to raise awareness of AI safety issues and the inadequacy of Asimov’s laws in particular. [70]

Boyer"), _ [Encyclopædia Britannica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclop%C3%A6dia_Britannica "Encyclopædia Britannica")_, [American Museum of Natural History](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Museum_of_Natural_History "American Museum of Natural History"), and [University of Arizona](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona "University of Arizona"). Click to enlarge.

Main article: [Accelerating change](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change "Accelerating change")

Some singularity proponents argue its inevitability through extrapolation of past trends, especially those pertaining to shortening gaps between improvements to technology. In one of the first uses of the term "singularity" in the context of technological progress, Stanislaw Ulam (1958) tells of a conversation with [John von Neumann](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann "John von Neumann") about accelerating change:

>  
One conversation centered on the ever accelerating progress of technology and changes in the mode of human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.

Hawkins (1983) writes that "mindsteps", dramatic and irreversible changes to paradigms or world views, are accelerating in frequency as quantified in his mindstep equation. He cites the inventions of writing, mathematics, and the computer as examples of such changes.

Kurzweil's analysis of history concludes that technological progress follows a pattern of [exponential growth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_growth "Exponential growth"), following what he calls the " [Law of Accelerating Returns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_change#Kurzweil.27s_The_Law_of_Accelerating_Returns "Accelerating change")". Whenever technology approaches a barrier, Kurzweil writes, new technologies will surmount it. He predicts [paradigm shifts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradigm_shift "Paradigm shift") will become increasingly common, leading to "technological change so rapid and profound it represents a rupture in the fabric of human history". [71] Kurzweil believes that the singularity will occur before the end of the 21st century, setting the [date at 2045](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictions_made_by_Raymond_Kurzweil#2045:_The_Singularity "Predictions made by Raymond Kurzweil"). [72] His predictions differ from Vinge’s in that he predicts a gradual ascent to the singularity, rather than Vinge’s rapidly self-improving superhuman intelligence.

Presumably, a technological singularity would lead to rapid development of a [Kardashev Type I civilization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kardashev_scale "Kardashev scale"), one that has achieved mastery of the resources of its home planet. [73]

Oft-cited dangers include those commonly associated with molecular nanotechnology and genetic engineering. These threats are major issues for both singularity advocates and critics, and were the subject of Bill Joy's _ [Wired](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine) "Wired (magazine)")_ magazine article " [Why the future doesn't need us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_future_doesn%27t_need_us "Why the future doesn't need us")". [74]

The [Acceleration Studies Foundation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration_Studies_Foundation "Acceleration Studies Foundation"), an educational non-profit foundation founded by [John Smart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smart_(futurist) "John Smart (futurist)"), engages in outreach, education, research and advocacy concerning accelerating change. [75] It produces the Accelerating Change conference at Stanford University, and maintains the educational site [Acceleration Watch](http://www.accelerationwatch.com/).

## Criticisms

Some critics assert that no computer or machine will ever achieve human intelligence, while others hold that the definition of intelligence is irrelevant if the net result is the same. [76]

[Steven Pinker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker "Steven Pinker") stated in 2008,

>  
"(...) There is not the slightest reason to believe in a coming singularity. The fact that you can visualize a future in your imagination is not evidence that it is likely or even possible. Look at domed cities, jet-pack commuting, underwater cities, mile-high buildings, and nuclear-powered automobiles—all staples of futuristic fantasies when I was a child that have never arrived. Sheer processing power is not a pixie dust that magically solves all your problems. (...)" [25]

Martin Ford in _The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future_ [77] postulates a "technology paradox" in that before the singularity could occur most routine jobs in the economy would be automated, since this would require a level of technology inferior to that of the singularity. This would cause massive unemployment and plummeting consumer demand, which in turn would destroy the incentive to invest in the technologies that would be required to bring about the Singularity. Job displacement is increasingly no longer limited to work traditionally considered to be "routine." [78]

[Jared Diamond](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Diamond "Jared Diamond"), in _ [Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed "Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed")_, argues that cultures self-limit when they exceed the sustainable carrying capacity of their environment, and the consumption of strategic resources (frequently timber, soils or water) creates a deleterious positive feedback loop that leads eventually to social collapse and technological retrogression.

[Theodore Modis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Modis "Theodore Modis") [79] [80] and [Jonathan Huebner](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonathan_Huebner "Jonathan Huebner") [81] argue that the rate of technological innovation has not only ceased to rise, but is actually now declining ( [John Smart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Smart_(futurist) "John Smart (futurist)"), however, criticizes Huebner's analysis [82]). Evidence for this decline is that the rise in computer [clock rates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate "Clock rate") is slowing, even while Moore's prediction of exponentially increasing circuit density continues to hold. This is due to excessive heat build-up from the chip, which cannot be dissipated quickly enough to prevent the chip from melting when operating at higher speeds. Advancements in speed may be possible in the future by virtue of more power-efficient CPU designs and multi-cell processors. [83] While Kurzweil used Modis' resources, and Modis' work was around accelerating change, Modis distanced himself from Kurzweil's thesis of a "technological singularity", claiming that it lacks scientific rigor. [80]

Others propose that other "singularities" can be found through analysis of trends in [world population](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population "World population"), world [gross domestic product](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product "Gross domestic product"), and other indices. [Andrey Korotayev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrey_Korotayev "Andrey Korotayev") and others argue that historical [hyperbolic growth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_growth "Hyperbolic growth") curves can be attributed to [feedback loops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedback_loop "Feedback loop") that ceased to affect global trends in the 1970s, and thus hyperbolic growth should not be expected in the future. [84] [85]

In _The Progress of Computing_, [William Nordhaus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Nordhaus "William Nordhaus") argued that, prior to 1940, computers followed the much slower growth of a traditional industrial economy, thus rejecting extrapolations of Moore's law to 19th-century computers. Schmidhuber (2006) suggests differences in memory of recent and distant events create an illusion of accelerating change, and that such phenomena may be responsible for past apocalyptic predictions.

Andrew Kennedy, in his 2006 paper for the [British Interplanetary Society](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Interplanetary_Society "British Interplanetary Society") discussing [change and the growth in space travel velocities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_Calculation "Wait Calculation"), [86] stated that although long-term overall growth is inevitable, it is small, embodying both ups and downs, and noted, "New technologies follow known laws of power use and information spread and are obliged to connect with what already exists. Remarkable theoretical discoveries, if they end up being used at all, play their part in maintaining the growth rate: they do not make its plotted curve... redundant." He stated that exponential growth is no predictor in itself, and illustrated this with examples such as [quantum theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics "Quantum mechanics"). The quantum was conceived in 1900, and quantum theory was in existence and accepted approximately 25 years later. However, it took over 40 years for [Richard Feynman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman") and others to produce meaningful numbers from the theory. [Bethe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Bethe "Hans Bethe") understood nuclear fusion in 1935, but 75 years later fusion reactors are still only used in experimental settings. Similarly, [quantum entanglement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement "Quantum entanglement") was understood in 1935 but not at the point of being used in practice until the 21st century.

A study of patents per thousand persons shows that human creativity does not show accelerating returns, but in fact, as suggested by [Joseph Tainter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Tainter "Joseph Tainter") in his seminal _The Collapse of Complex Societies_, [87] a law of [diminishing returns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diminishing_returns "Diminishing returns"). The number of patents per thousand peaked in the period from 1850 to 1900, and has been declining since. [81] The growth of complexity eventually becomes self-limiting, and leads to a widespread "general systems collapse".

In addition to general criticisms of the singularity concept, several critics have raised issues with Kurzweil's iconic chart. One line of criticism is that a [log-log](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-log_plot "Log-log plot") chart of this nature is inherently biased toward a straight-line result. Others identify selection bias in the points that Kurzweil chooses to use. For example, biologist [PZ Myers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZ_Myers "PZ Myers") points out that many of the early evolutionary "events" were picked arbitrarily. [88] Kurzweil has rebutted this by charting evolutionary events from 15 neutral sources, and showing that they fit a straight line on [a log-log chart](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg "File:ParadigmShiftsFrr15Events.svg"). _ [The Economist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist "The Economist")_ mocked the concept with a graph extrapolating that the number of blades on a razor, which has increased over the years from one to as many as five, will increase ever-faster to infinity. [89]

## In popular culture

See also: [List of fictional computers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_computers "List of fictional computers")

[Isaac Asimov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov")'s 1950 story " [The Evitable Conflict](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Evitable_Conflict "The Evitable Conflict")", (the last part of the _ [I, Robot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot "I, Robot")_ collection) features the Machines, four supercomputers managing the world's economy. The computers are incomprehensible to humans and are impossible to analyze for errors, having been created through 10 stages of [bootstrapping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping "Bootstrapping"). In the end of the story, it is implied that from now on (it occurs in 2052), no major conflict can occur, and the Machines are going to guide humanity toward a better future, one only they are capable of seeing (and know to truly be the best). [Susan Calvin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Calvin "Susan Calvin") states that "For all time, all conflicts are finally evitable. Only the Machines, from now on, are inevitable!"

[James P. Hogan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_P._Hogan_(writer) "James P. Hogan (writer)")'s 1979 novel _The Two Faces of Tomorrow_ is an explicit description of what is now called the Singularity. An artificial intelligence system solves an excavation problem on the moon in a brilliant and novel way, but nearly kills a work crew in the process. Realizing that systems are becoming too sophisticated and complex to predict or manage, a scientific team sets out to teach a sophisticated computer network how to think more humanly. The story documents the rise of self-awareness in the computer system, the humans' loss of control and failed attempts to shut down the experiment as the computer desperately defends itself, and the computer intelligence reaching maturity.

While discussing the singularity's growing recognition, Vernor Vinge wrote in 1993 that "it was the science-fiction writers who felt the first concrete impact." In addition to his own short story "Bookworm, Run!", whose protagonist is a chimpanzee with intelligence augmented by a government experiment, he cites [Greg Bear](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Bear "Greg Bear")'s novel _ [Blood Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Music_(novel) "Blood Music (novel)")_ (1983) as an example of the singularity in fiction. Vinge described surviving the singularity in his 1986 novel _ [Marooned in Realtime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marooned_in_Realtime "Marooned in Realtime")_. Vinge later expanded the notion of the singularity to a galactic scale in _ [A Fire Upon the Deep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep "A Fire Upon the Deep")_ (1992), a novel populated by transcendent beings, each the product of a different race and possessed of distinct agendas and overwhelming power.

In [William Gibson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson "William Gibson")'s 1984 novel _ [Neuromancer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer "Neuromancer")_, artificial intelligences capable of improving their own programs are strictly regulated by special "Turing police" to ensure they never exceed a certain level of intelligence, and the plot centers on the efforts of one such AI to circumvent their control. The 1994 novel _ [The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect")_ features an AI that augments itself so quickly as to gain low-level control of all matter in the universe in a matter of hours.

[William Gibson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson "William Gibson") and [Bruce Sterling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling "Bruce Sterling")'s [alternate history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_history "Alternate history") [Steampunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk "Steampunk") novel _ [The Difference Engine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Difference_Engine "The Difference Engine")_ ends with a vision of the singularity occurring in 1991 with a superintelligent computer that has merged its mind with the inhabitants of London.

A more malevolent AI achieves similar levels of omnipotence in [Harlan Ellison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlan_Ellison "Harlan Ellison")'s short story _ [I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream")_ (1967).

[William Thomas Quick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Thomas_Quick "William Thomas Quick")'s novels _Dreams of Flesh and Sand_ (1988), _Dreams of Gods and Men_ (1989), and _Singularities_ (1990) present an account of the transition through the singularity; in the last novel, one of the characters states that mankind's survival requires it to integrate with the emerging machine intelligences, or it will be crushed under the dominance of the machines—the greatest risk to the survival of a species reaching this point (and alluding to large numbers of other species that either survived or failed this test, although no actual contact with alien species occurs in the novels).

The singularity is sometimes addressed in fictional works to explain the event's absence. [Neal Asher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Asher "Neal Asher")'s _ [Gridlinked](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gridlinked "Gridlinked")_ series features a future where humans living in the Polity are governed by AIs and while some are resentful, most believe that they are far better governors than any human. In the fourth novel, _ [Polity Agent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polity_Agent "Polity Agent")_, it is mentioned that the singularity is far overdue yet most AIs have decided not to partake in it for reasons that only they know. A flashback character in [Ken MacLeod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_MacLeod "Ken MacLeod")'s 1998 novel _The Cassini Division_ dismissively refers to the singularity as "the [Rapture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapture "Rapture") for nerds", though the singularity goes on to happen anyway.

Popular movies in which computers become intelligent and violently overpower the human race include _ [Colossus: The Forbin Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project "Colossus: The Forbin Project")_, the _ [Terminator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_(franchise) "Terminator (franchise)")_ series, the very loose film adaptation of _ [I, Robot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I,_Robot_(film) "I, Robot (film)")_, and _ [The Matrix](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(series) "The Matrix (series)")_ series. The television series _ [Battlestar Galactica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series) "Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)")_ also explores these themes.

[Isaac Asimov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Asimov "Isaac Asimov") expressed ideas similar to a post-Kurzweilian singularity in his short story " [The Last Question](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Question "The Last Question")". Asimov's future envisions a reality where a combination of [strong artificial intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_artificial_intelligence "Strong artificial intelligence") and [post-humans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-human "Post-human") consume the cosmos, during a time Kurzweil describes as when "the universe wakes up", the last of his six stages of cosmic evolution as described in _ [The Singularity is Near](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Singularity_is_Near "The Singularity is Near")_. Post-human entities throughout various time periods of the story inquire of the artificial intelligence within the story as to how [entropy death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe "Heat death of the universe") will be avoided. The AI responds that it lacks sufficient information to come to a conclusion, until the end of the story when the AI does indeed arrive at a solution. Notably, it does so in order to fulfill its [duty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics "Three Laws of Robotics") to answer the humans' question.

[St. Edward's University](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Edward%27s_University "St. Edward's University") chemist [Eamonn Healy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_Healy "Eamonn Healy") discusses accelerating change in the film _ [Waking Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waking_Life "Waking Life")_. He divides history into increasingly shorter periods, estimating "two billion years for life, six million years for the hominid, a hundred-thousand years for mankind as we know it". He proceeds to human cultural evolution, giving time scales of ten thousand years for agriculture, four hundred years for the scientific revolution, and one hundred fifty years for the industrial revolution. Information is emphasized as providing the basis for the new evolutionary paradigm, with artificial intelligence its culmination. He concludes we will eventually create "neohumans" which will usurp humanity’s present role in scientific and technological progress and allow the exponential trend of accelerating change to continue past the limits of human ability.

Accelerating progress features in some science fiction works, and is a central theme in [Charles Stross](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stross "Charles Stross")'s [_Accelerando_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerando_(book) "Accelerando (book)"). Other notable authors that address singularity-related issues include [Karl Schroeder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Schroeder "Karl Schroeder"), [Greg Egan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Egan "Greg Egan"), [Ken MacLeod](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_MacLeod "Ken MacLeod"), [Rudy Rucker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudy_Rucker "Rudy Rucker"), [David Brin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brin "David Brin"), [Iain M.

The feature-length documentary film _ [Transcendent Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendent_Man_(film) "Transcendent Man (film)")_ by [Barry Ptolemy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Ptolemy "Barry Ptolemy") is based on Kurzweil and his book _The Singularity Is Near_. The film documents Kurzweil's quest to reveal what he believes to be mankind's destiny. Another documentary, _ [Plug & Pray](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plug_%26_Pray "Plug & Pray")_, focuses on the promise, problems and ethics of artificial intelligence and robotics, with [Joseph Weizenbaum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum "Joseph Weizenbaum") and Kurzweil as the main subjects of the film. [90]

In 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently discover new scientific findings. [91] Also in 2009, researchers at [Cornell](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornell "Cornell") developed a computer program that extrapolated the laws of motion from a pendulum's swings. [92] [93]

A Tamil film Enthiran deals with a humanoid robot having an intelligence equivalent to that of a human and wrecking havoc causing a struggle for existence

The web comic [Dresden Codak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden_Codak "Dresden Codak") deals with trans-humanistic themes and the singularity.

The plot of an episode of the TV program _ [The Big Bang Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory "The Big Bang Theory")_ (season 4, episode 2, "The Cruciferous Vegetable Amplification") revolves around the anticipated date of the coming Singularity.

The seventeenth episode of the sixth season of the TV sitcom _Futurama_, "Benderama" references Bender reaching the technological singularity and being able to infinitely produce smaller versions of himself to wreak havoc on the world.

[Industrial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Music "Industrial Music")/ [Steampunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk "Steampunk") entertainer [Doctor Steel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Steel "Doctor Steel") weaves the concept of a technological singularity into his music and videos, even having a song entitled _The Singularity_. He has been interviewed on his views by the [Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Ethics_and_Emerging_Technologies "Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies"), [94] and has also authored a paper on the subject. [95] [96]

In 2012, concept band [SOLA-MI](http://sola-mi.com), released "NEXUS (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)," an album about the first waking machine.

In the sci-fi webseries [Sync](http://imdb.com/title/tt2317127/), a [computer virus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus "Computer virus") takes over a computerized human and becomes a singularity.

The context for this statement is as follows: "we will be producing about 1026 to 1029 cps of nonbiological computation per year in the early 2030s. This is roughly equal to our estimate for the capacity of all living biological human intelligence ... This state of computation in the early 2030s will not represent the Singularity, however, because it does not yet correspond to a profound expansion of our intelligence. By the mid-2040s, however, that one thousand dollars' worth of computation will be equal to 1026 cps, so the intelligence created per year (at a total cost of about $1012) will be about one billion times more powerful than all human intelligence today. That _will_ indeed represent a profound change, and it is for that reason that I set the date for the Singularity—representing a profound and disruptive transformation in human capability—as 2045."

> Some people say that computers can never show true intelligence whatever that may be. But it seems to me that if very complicated chemical molecules can operate in humans to make them intelligent then equally complicated electronic circuits can also make computers act in an intelligent way. And if they are intelligent they can presumably design computers that have even greater complexity and intelligence.
